The data shows the search result of a DARTS variant for neural network architecture search. I have calculated the feature map output weights for the nodes and the operation weights for each edge. The number after `dstnode` represents the weight of that node. I have already selected the operation with the highest weight from each edge and calculated the global relative weight of the operation by multiplying the source node weight by the operation weight (this is pre-calculated in parentheses, so you do not need to compute it). Here, `skipconnect` refers to an identity mapping, and `none` indicates a disconnected connection.

Now, you need to carefully design a sub-network based on this information, selecting 8-10 edges to form the new network. Edges originating from different nodes have varying information flow strengths and thus cannot be directly compared. You need to infer based on the starting node (note that node weights are indicated on the `dstnode`). Edge weights originating from the same node are comparable. The weight of the starting node influences the strength of its outgoing edges.

First, consider input nodes -2 and -1, as they do not have node weights. Connect them to nodes with high connection weights or choose edges with high weights. Select 4-7 input edges. For connections between other nodes, rank the edges based on their global relative weights and select accordingly. Do not try to balance the number of input edges and intra-cell edges; prioritize input edges. If input edges have high and similar weights, select all of them. You should take control of the overall topology. Ensure the cell has enough inputs and the complexity of the inner structure.

Additionally, you should adhere to the following strategies: `skip\_connect` operations should not form a continuous path, and you should avoid selecting a large number of pooling operations. After identifying candidate edges, you also need to comprehensively evaluate the rationality of the network's topological structure, ensure it effectively forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and no node is discarded. Please think carefully and provide the result.

The data pertains to the node feature maps, output node weights for each cell within the DARTS (Differentiable Architecture Search) neural architecture search method, observed after a period of training. You are now required to consider the addition of a hidden node to this cell. This node should not serve as a direct external output of the cell; rather, its purpose is to enhance the structure. It could be connected in parallel with an existing node, or it could link with a bottleneck node or nodes with high weight. You must take into account the overall network topology and connectivity to propose a specific solution.
